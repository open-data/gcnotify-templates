  Followed, is a list of Organizations that are on the [Portal](https://open.canada.ca)
  but _**not**_ on the [Registry](https://registry.open.canada.ca).


  This excludes Organizations which should _**only**_ be on the Portal, such as Provinces
  (ab, mb, nb, qc, nwt-tno, and yk).


  **((diff))**


  If you do not receive this alert, you can assume that the Organizations on the Registry
  and Portal are synced correctly.
